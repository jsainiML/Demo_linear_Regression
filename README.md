# Demo_linear_Regression
I wrote this code on Pytorch that shows how a NN model trained on small set of tensors can predict data using linear regression with methods like Backpropogation and gradient descent.

### Model Prediction before Training 

The following image depict how our model was predicting with randomly initialized weights pre-training.

### Model Prediction After Training.

As we can see after training the model over numerous epochs model was able to predict well within the expected manner.

### Slope in Loss fuction 

The trend for loss function indicates how well it was performing after certain loops.
