# Demo_linear_Regression
I wrote this code on Pytorch to show how a NN model trained on small set of tensors can predict data using linear regression with methods like Backpropogation and gradient descent. 

### Linear DataSet

### Model Prediction before Training 

The following image depict how our model was predicting with randomly initialized weights pre-training.

### Model Prediction After Training.

As we can see after training the model over numerous epochs model was able to predict well within the expected manner.

### Slope in Loss fuction 

The trend for loss fucntion indicates how well it was perfroming after certain loops.
